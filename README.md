# Pomodoro Clock

A productivity app based on the Pomodoro Technique.

Demo Link: https://thairyo.github.io/PomodoroClock/

Built using ReactJS and Material-ui.

Current functionalities include:

- Customize work, break, and extended break times.
- Pause current session or completely reset the app.

Note: It was an intentional design choice that the user must press the "start" button to start every session--the clock won't move on to the next session automatically. When the work session finishes, the user may need an extra minute or two to finish the immediate task at hand (and, for example, won't just stop in the middle of writing an email). Likewise, if the user leaves the computer during a break and the session finishes, the clock won't automatically start a work session.
